# Apple Security &amp; RSR

This repository contains information extracted from Apple’s security advisories from 2020 up to the date of publication. The data may be inconsistent due to discrepancies within the advisories themselves, which often feature varying structures and modifications to publication and update dates for certain entries. The purpose of this repository is twofold: to **highlight** how Apple has effectively created a *“Subscription Mode”* —without billing for the moment (joke)— where users must personally monitor these changes (consider [security-announce](https://lists.apple.com/archives/security-announce/2024) obsolete for quite some time now), and to provide useful information for others, as these data were used in a past presentation I gave *some time ago* (where other main topics were discussed, but among other things, this growing model, security regressions, silent fixes, average lifecycle of vulnerabilities., etc).

The reasons for these changes range from simple oversights in publication, poor triage, or attempts to coordinate between different affected products (quite common when there is a release window between macOS and iOS/iPadOS or WebKit ports) to avoid premature disclosure of details. However, it might also be a method of controlling Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (no evidence, no crime).
